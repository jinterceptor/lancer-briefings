### UNION BRIEFING DOCUMENTMISSION 01: BUG HUNT

## SITUATION OVERVIEW:

Evergreen Colony on Hercynia has come under sustained attack by unidentified hostile forces, causing significant disruptions and casualties. The situation is destabilizing rapidly, threatening the long-term viability of the settlement. Initial intelligence suggests the attackers may be remnants of a hostile indigenous group, though evidence points strongly to human raiders.

## MISSION OBJECTIVES:

Stabilize the security situation around Evergreen.

Track, identify, and neutralize the hostile force behind the ongoing raids.

Investigate the attackers to determine their true nature and origin.

Halt the attacks on Evergreen and outlying homesteads.

## CRITICAL TASKS:

# PROTECT THE ENGINEERS

Assist Chief Engineer Castor Fielding's team as they complete urgent repairs on Evergreen’s landing bowl. Securing this infrastructure is vital for future supply drops and reinforcements.

OR

# TRAPDOOR SPIDER

Pursue and neutralize the sniper actively targeting Evergreen’s militia and civilian population. Eliminating this threat will significantly improve colony security and morale.

## STAKES:

Failure in any of these critical tasks will severely degrade Evergreen's operational capacity.

Failing to secure the landing bowl or neutralize the sniper will leave critical infrastructure or personnel at high risk.

## MISSION REWARD:

Upon successful stabilization of Evergreen and neutralization of immediate threats, Union will grant sufficient privileges, licenses, and resources for all pilots involved to advance to License Level 1 (LL1).

Possible issuance of a core battery unit, awarded by Chief Engineer Castor Fielding as recognition for exceptional performance.

### RESERVES AVAILABILITY:

No reserves available for this mission. All pilots and assets must rely on immediate tactical resources and improvisation.

## ACTION REPORTING:

Pilots are required to submit timely and detailed after-action reports via Omninet for Union analysis and further operational planning.
