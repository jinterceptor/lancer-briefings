# Mission // #003
## DAYBREAK

Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/commercial district. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city. The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming/optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Goals
- Neutralize the enemyâ€™s comms jamming network, then locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Stakes
- Following this mission, the squads' actions will be recognized, earning them a promotion to LL2. Mission success may also grant them access to additional prototype Exotic Gear that they can then utilize during future missions to come.

# Rewards
- Once you arrive at FOB Saber, the situation on the ground will be  evaluated and field upgrades distributed accordingly.
-  1st Lt. Kim may also authorize the distribution of advanced weapons and systems depending on performance.

# Reserves
- None.
