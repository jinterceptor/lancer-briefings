# Mission // #003
## A DAY OF FIRSTS

The team is cleared to engage all hostile targets. Expect strong resistance while  operating within enemy territory. Local Vestan  defense patrols are noted to be highly mobile and aggressive; counter-mobility and anti-armor capabilities are strongly advised.

# Goals
- Insert into Vestan territory.
- Link up with local resistance forces.
- Gather additional supplies and equipment as necessary and seize control of the suspected TARTARUS facility.
- Destruction of the facility has been approved if necessary.

# Stakes
- Inability to assist resistance forces will severely diminish their effective capabilities. The TARTARUS facility itself remains a mystery, but failure to take it quickly may result in the loss of valuable intelligence, hostages, and potentially even more serious consequences depending on the exact nature of TARTARUS itself.

# Rewards
- Upon completion of this mission, Scythe Company will be authorized to receive upgrades and permissions corresponding to an additional license level. Further rewards may be allocated based on mission performance
