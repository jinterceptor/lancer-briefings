# Mission // #004
## The Typhon

After months of dodging and hiding, Scythe company are finally told to suit up and take the fight to the Vestans. Using a Space Elevator, the pilots will board the Typhon and destroy it.

# Mission Objectives

Infiltrate the Pharos 1 space elevator, 

board the VNS Typhon, 

make your way to the ship’s primary reactor, and destroy it by any means necessary.

# Mission Parameters:

Anticipate heavy resistance and intense close-quarters combat both within the space elevator and the ship itself. Due to the area of operations, exoatmospheric/null-grav traversal capabilities are highly recommended. (Loadout suggestions include flight or zero-gravity maneuvering systems, traits, or abilities, and weapons and systems capable of destroying terrain).

# Stakes:

Failure to destroy the Typhon will leave the hard line Vestan government in a position to continue to dominate Cressidium’s orbit uncontested, and may result in reprisal strikes. Security measures will doubtless be reinforced in the aftermath of an assault on the ship, rendering future attempts against it nigh impossible and endangering further resistance efforts until additional Union reinforcements can arrive (ETA: 24 months).

# Reward:

Following this critical mission, the PCs will be authorized to receive an additional license level and will likely receive further commendations for their efforts.
