## The Drop

Mechs and Marines from the Rio Grande will deploy near a staging area located in Nov Elysia's industrial district designated Forward operating Base Saber. Once assembled, they'll resupply if necessary and then move out towards the central district where the diplomatic talks were taking place, heading for the last known location of the captain and the ambassador. After the VIP's have been secured, they'll be escorded back through a defensive perimeter established by a second wave of Union forces to a safe location away from the fighting and extracted by shuttle back to the Rio Grande

# Goals

# Stakes
