## MISSION 02: VIGILANT GAZE

### SITUATION OVERVIEW:
Following the successful stabilization of Evergreen during initial operations, Cinder Squad has remained on-station within the colony perimeter for strategic readiness. In recent days, surveillance reports and militia recon patrols have indicated increased hostile activity beyond the walls of Evergreen, including rapid movement signatures, power anomalies, and coordinated disruptions across multiple sectors.

As of 04:00 local time, Evergreen came under direct and coordinated assault by hostile HUC-aligned forces. Initial strikes appear to have been feints designed to probe and test colonial defenses, followed by a focused push on the southern wall. Cinder Squad is to deploy immediately to defend the breach and prevent the enemy from advancing into the settlement proper.

This is the first full-scale incursion Evergreen has faced.

### MISSION OBJECTIVE:

Cinder Squad is tasked with preventing further hostile forces from entering the colony through breach point SE-12 and eliminating any active units within the perimeter.

Patience has initiated an all-points defensive protocol and will be coordinating from the Evergreen command node. Additional support from local militia and automated defenses is ongoing but cannot be relied on for complete perimeter control.

### STAKES:

Failure to contain or eliminate this assault will result in:

Damage to critical infrastructure (including the landing bowl, power grid, and command node).

Civilian casualties and the potential collapse of morale within Evergreen.

Loss of strategic foothold on Hercynia and weakening of Union authority in the region.

A breach must be avoided at all costs.

### MISSION REWARD:

Upon successful defense of Evergreen, Union will authorize the following:

Full License Level increase to LL2 for all active members of Cinder Squad.

Continued priority access to Evergreen’s printing, fabrication, and logistics systems.

### RESERVES AVAILABLE:

1x Patience Hookup – Real-time tactical oversight and data relay from Evergreen’s NHP administrator.

1x Core Battery – Can be used to fully restore a mech’s core power during the mission. Single-use.

### ACTION REPORTING:

As with previous engagements, all telemetry, engagement logs, and post-mission analysis must be uploaded to Union's command servers via secure Omninet link for strategic review.
