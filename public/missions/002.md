# Mission // #002
## The Drop

Mechs and Marines from the Rio Grande will deploy near a staging area located in Nov Elysia's industrial district designated Forward operating Base Saber. Once assembled, they'll resupply if necessary and then move out towards the central district where the diplomatic talks were taking place, heading for the last known location of the captain and the ambassador. After the VIP's have been secured, they'll be escorded back through a defensive perimeter established by a second wave of Union forces to a safe location away from the fighting and extracted by shuttle back to the Rio Grande

# Goals
- Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders.

# Stakes
- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Rewards
- Once you arrive at FOB Saber, the situation on the ground will be  evaluated and field upgrades distributed accordingly.
-  1st Lt. Kim may also authorize the distribution of advanced weapons and systems depending on performance.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
