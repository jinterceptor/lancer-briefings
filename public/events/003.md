# MISSION PARAMETERS

The briefing for this upcoming operation takes place a 
week before the LSA is set to begin an offensive against 
the Vestan city of Grevka. Preparations for large-scale 
military actions like this require round-the-clock activity, 
and the Task Force Indigo base is no exception to this. 
The site is alive with an endless procession of supply 
shipments, maintenance and equipment checks, strategy 
meetings, training, and briefings like this one.

# EVENT LOG

- Scythe Company deployed via horizontal drop onto Vestan controlled beachhead, supported by a distraction made by LSA cruise missile.
- Scythe Company was able to dispatch Vestan forces before any alarms could be raised, resulting in the Sovereignty not yet being aware of their presence.
- After meeting up with Gerou, the squad moves stealthily through the forest to the town of Metina.
- After a short downtime in which they learn more about Project Tartarus and a facility called Angopolis, the squad meets their contact.
- Avel, a non-combat NHP, supplies the location and codes of a concealed munitions depot that the resistance plans to raid for heavy weapons and supplies prior to the assault on Angopolis.
- In addition, Avel mentions multiple instances where NHP's were taken as part of project TARTARUS, and wanting no part in whatever is ocurring at the facility.
