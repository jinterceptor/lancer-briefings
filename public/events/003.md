The briefing for this upcoming operation takes place a 
week before the LSA is set to begin an offensive against 
the Vestan city of Grevka. Preparations for large-scale 
military actions like this require round-the-clock activity, 
and the Task Force Indigo base is no exception to this. 
The site is alive with an endless procession of supply 
shipments, maintenance and equipment checks, strategy 
meetings, training, and briefings like this one.
