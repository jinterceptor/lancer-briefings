### UNION OPERATIONS LOG — HERCYNIA CRISIS RESPONSE

# RE: MISSION 02 — VIGILANT GAZE

# LOCATION: Evergreen Colony, Hercynia

# AUTHOR: Adjutant Kal Sorrento, Union Administrative Liaison

# STATUS: MISSION COMPLETE

# ATTACHED: Action Reports, Tactical Logs, Debrief Transcripts

### SUMMARY OF EVENTS

## > 01. NIGHT STRIKE – HUC ATTACK ON EVERGREEN

CINDER SQUAD rapidly responded to a nighttime incursion by Hercynian United Cities (HUC) forces. Initial attack identified as coordinated diversionary tactic.

* Hostile forces engaged and repelled with minimal colony damage.
* Enemy elements withdrew after limited resistance, prompting suspicion of secondary objectives.

## > 02. REACTOR DEFENSE OPERATION

Following intel regarding HUC feint, CINDER SQUAD redeployed urgently to secure Stable Reactor Facilities downriver from Evergreen.

* Stable Reactor 1 sustained critical damage; power regulator destroyed prior to squad arrival.
* Stable Reactor 2 successfully defended; critical colony power infrastructure preserved.
* Enemy forces eliminated, preventing further sabotage.

## > 03. EMERGENCY ENGAGEMENT — ENKIDU-CLASS THREAT (“REGRET”)

CINDER SQUAD intercepted a highly aggressive HUC assault led by REGRET, a Hercynian Crisis-era Enkidu chassis piloted by extremist Anander Danjuro.

* REGRET breached Evergreen’s perimeter, inflicting substantial civilian casualties and infrastructure damage.
* Squad neutralized REGRET prior to reactor overload and detonation, preventing catastrophic loss.
* Pilot Anander Danjuro confirmed killed in action; remaining HUC forces disengaged.

## > 04. INTERROGATION INCIDENT (SMOKEY)

CINDER SQUAD member Smokey conducted unauthorized interrogation of POW Psalm, resulting in accidental prisoner fatalities.

* Psalm provided limited actionable intel: REGRET independently activated by extremist factions within HUC.
* Official reprimand logged; future POW interactions restricted without Union oversight.

## > 05. DIPLOMATIC CONTACT – HUC COMMANDER DTHALL

Direct communications initiated by HUC Commander Dthall seeking ceasefire negotiations:

* Expressed regret regarding escalation and attacks on Evergreen.
* Requested immediate POW exchange and cessation of hostilities.
* Warned of imminent threat from an entity identified as “the Machine.”

## > 06. ANOMALOUS ACTIVITY – SUBALTERN SIGNAL

Colony subalterns and drones observed exhibiting increasingly erratic behaviors, drifting eastward en masse due to unidentified signal interference.

* Preliminary investigation links anomalous behavior to signal affecting Administrator Patience.
* Administrator Patience scheduled for immediate system cycling to mitigate potential cascading errors.

## > 07. INTERMISSION — SQUAD DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES

During operational lull, CINDER SQUAD undertook critical support and intel-gathering actions:

* **Vet** successfully reorganized and enhanced Evergreen militia efficiency, including establishing a mech pilot training regimen. Owes Chief Engineer Fielding a favor.
* **Ferryman** conducted covert Union communication surveillance; confirmed no advanced intel regarding SSC interests. Privately confronted Smokey regarding POW incident.
* **Smokey** received severe reprimand from Union command following interrogation incident.
* **Outlaw** collaborated secretly with Edena Ji regarding internal cognitive anomalies. Successfully infiltrated Administrator Patience’s logs; identified encrypted references to external contamination and backup site (“Quiet Night”). Sustained minor NHP stress feedback.
* **Huntsman** executed solo wilderness reconnaissance. Confirmed ecological disruptions; encountered direct HUC Ranger contact, resulting in increased personal security awareness.
* **Vanisher** secured critical intel and repaired previously faulty shielding module, significantly enhancing combat readiness.

### STATUS UPDATE

Evergreen remains vulnerable; critical repairs ongoing. HUC ceasefire tentative and contingent upon POW exchange negotiations.
Subaltern anomaly linked to external signal of unknown origin continues to escalate, potentially compromising colony infrastructure and administrator systems.

CINDER SQUAD granted LL2 resource allocation clearance. Squad authorized ongoing defensive posture, signal source investigation, and cautious diplomatic engagement.

Further directives pending analysis.
