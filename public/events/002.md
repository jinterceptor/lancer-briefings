# MISSION PARAMETERS:
As the night wears on, the team finally catches some rest. Yet, the rising sun barely begins to touch the horizon when they are stirred awake. The relentless rain has finally ceased, and the base is now alive with a sense of urgency. Couriers rush in with news that LSA reinforcements have begun gathering just outside Nov Elysia, poised for a coordinated assault to reclaim the city's central district from Sovereignty control. The hope is that once the district falls back into friendly hands, locating both the captain and the ambassador will swiftly follow.

But the team won't be part of that larger operation. Instead, as 1st Lt. Kim and Rio explain in a briefing via omnihook, they've been assigned a mission of even greater significance. The jamming that has blanketed the city must be dealt with—without communication, the LSA’s push to retake the central district could be systematically dismantled.

Thanks to intel gathered by Union squads arriving at FOB Saber, it's become clear that the Sovereignty has set up a network of jamming transmitters throughout the city. While some squads managed to destroy a few units during their trek to the base, the overall network remains intact.

The task at hand is to neutralize this network, and Rio has devised a plan: a viral code-spike package that, once uploaded at any one of the transmitter points, should bring down the entire system. The program has already been loaded onto the team’s mechs; now, all they need to do is locate a transmitter, get close enough to establish a secure link, and let the program do its work. However, this will require getting close to a transmitter and holding the area long enough for the upload to complete.

Local LSA forces have identified a potential target within striking distance of FOB Saber, but the intel also indicates that Sovereignty forces are heavily reinforcing the site, including airborne units on patrol. Once the team finishes their final checks on their mechs and ensures everything is ready, they will head back out into the city. Their mission: take down that transmitter and end the jamming, once and for all.
