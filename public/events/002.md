# MISSION PARAMETERS:
As the night wears on, the team finally catches some rest. Yet, the rising sun barely begins to touch the horizon when they are stirred awake. The relentless rain has finally ceased, and the base is now alive with a sense of urgency. Couriers rush in with news that LSA reinforcements have begun gathering just outside Nov Elysia, poised for a coordinated assault to reclaim the city's central district from Sovereignty control. The hope is that once the district falls back into friendly hands, locating both the captain and the ambassador will swiftly follow.

But the team won't be part of that larger operation. Instead, as 1st Lt. Kim and Rio explain in a briefing via omnihook, they've been assigned a mission of even greater significance. The jamming that has blanketed the city must be dealt with—without communication, the LSA’s push to retake the central district could be systematically dismantled.

Thanks to intel gathered by Union squads arriving at FOB Saber, it's become clear that the Sovereignty has set up a network of jamming transmitters throughout the city. While some squads managed to destroy a few units during their trek to the base, the overall network remains intact.

The task at hand is to neutralize this network, and Rio has devised a plan: a viral code-spike package that, once uploaded at any one of the transmitter points, should bring down the entire system. The program has already been loaded onto the team’s mechs; now, all they need to do is locate a transmitter, get close enough to establish a secure link, and let the program do its work. However, this will require getting close to a transmitter and holding the area long enough for the upload to complete.

Local LSA forces have identified a potential target within striking distance of FOB Saber, but the intel also indicates that Sovereignty forces are heavily reinforcing the site, including airborne units on patrol. Once the team finishes their final checks on their mechs and ensures everything is ready, they will head back out into the city. Their mission: take down that transmitter and end the jamming, once and for all.

# EVENT LOG:
* Having reached FOB Saber, the squad prepares for some much needed R&R and, in some cases, medical treatment.
* Brimstone assisted a civilian contingent with locating supplies, and though he earned their favour and a pat on the back, his assistance was not enough to gain anything more.
* SniperShell watched turtles race, it was very entertaining.
* Cleric spent his time slamming away at a keyboard, attempting to create a new modification for his Lancer. Unfortunately despite many hours of grinding, he is unsucessful.
* Mountaintop made a friend in the local PDF Contingent named Private Regas. A few quick falsified stories later and rumours spread like wildfire throughout the region about a Pilot who single-handedly saved all the surviving reinforcements.
* Junkie partakes in a particularly volotile of combat drugs and extra-strength coffee, resulting in a medical emergency, several concussed officers, and another line added to his 27-page disciplinary record.
* Strongback, the newest member of the squad, assisted the local Reclamation crews in recycling a mound of scrap metal into fresh material for the only available Printer. After providing the assistance, he was able to attain a Redundant Repair module.
* Now refreshed and with newly printed mechs, the squad sits down in a hodgepodge breifing room to plan their next mission.
* Having completed their briefing, the squad deploys via dropship to upload a code-spike developed by Rio to the Financial District of Nov Elysia.
* After a hard-fought battle, the squad is able to upload the Spike, dropping the communications jamming that had spread across the whole City.
* With communications cleaned up, the LSA were able to launch a coordinated assault against the Sovereignty.
* Analysis of both the jamming transmitters and the downed Sovereignty e-war rigs grants one Pilot a hastily-compiled wideband spoofing program that can be activated to blind enemy sensors.
* With their first objective complete, they're suddenly diverted from their plan to regroup with LSA forces by Rio, who'd just picked up the Captain's Ontoloci implants.
* Instead, the squad is transported to a local port where a Stealth Submarine is spotted emerging from the waves.
* Both the Captain and the Ambassador can be seen being taken to the Submarine, and they're already aboard by the time the squad deployts to rescue them. Now the squad is against the clock to secure the Submarine before it can drop back below the waves and escape with the hostages.
