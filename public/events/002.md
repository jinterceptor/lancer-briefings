# MISSION PARAMETERS:
After a brief rest, the PCs are informed that while LSA reinforcements are preparing to retake the central district of Nov Elysia, their mission is to neutralize a network of jamming transmitters deployed by the Sovereignty. This jamming has been hindering LSA's coordination, and to disable it, the PCs need to upload a viral code-spike to a transmitter unit. They must locate a transmitter, likely near FOB Saber and heavily defended, to carry out the task and enable proper communication for the LSA's operations.

# EVENT LOG:
* Squad has reached FOB Sabre for Downtime.
