## MISSION PARAMETERS:

As the night wears on, the squad finally catches some much-needed rest. However, the rising sun barely begins to touch the horizon when they are stirred awake. The relentless rain has finally ceased, and the base is now alive with a sense of urgency. Couriers rush in with news that LSA reinforcements have begun gathering just outside Nov Elysia, poised for a coordinated assault to reclaim the city's central district from Sovereignty control. The hope is that once the district falls back into friendly hands, locating both the Captain and the Ambassador will swiftly follow.

But the squad wasn't part of that larger operation. Instead, 1st Lt. Kim and Rio briefed them via omnihook on a mission of even greater significance: the jamming blanket that had crippled communications across the city needed to be neutralized. Without it, the LSA's push to retake the central district could be systematically dismantled.

Thanks to intel gathered by Union squads arriving at FOB Saber, it became clear that the Sovereignty had set up a network of jamming transmitters throughout the city. While some squads managed to destroy a few units during their trek to the base, the overall network remained intact.

The task at hand was to neutralize this network, and Rio devised a plan: a viral code-spike package that, once uploaded at any one of the transmitter points, would bring down the entire system. The program was already loaded onto the squad's mechs; their mission was to locate a transmitter, get close enough to establish a secure link, and let the program do its work. However, this required getting close to a transmitter and holding the area long enough for the upload to complete.

## EVENT LOG:

The squad deployed to the Financial District of Nov Elysia, where they located a heavily fortified transmitter site. Despite significant resistance, including aerial patrols and entrenched enemy forces, they managed to secure the area.
The upload process was tense, with enemy reinforcements attempting to disrupt their mission. However, the squad held the line, repelling waves of attackers until the code-spike completed successfully.
With the jamming network neutralized, the LSA's communication channels cleared up, allowing for a coordinated assault on the city's central district.
Rescue Operation - Port Raid:

Shortly after completing their first objective, the squad was redirected to a nearby port. Rio had detected the Captain’s Ontoloci implants, pinpointing the location of a stealth submarine preparing to submerge with both the Captain and Ambassador aboard.
Racing against the clock, the squad launched a daring raid on the port. Despite heavy resistance from Sovereignty forces guarding the submarine, they managed to break through.
The team successfully boarded the submarine, rescuing both the Captain and Ambassador moments before it could submerge. The extraction was swift, with the squad returning to the surface just as LSA reinforcements arrived to secure the port.
Ambush - Sorvan’s Assault:

As the squad regrouped and prepared to leave the area, they were suddenly ambushed by Colonel Sorvan Kiros and a detachment of elite Vestan mechs. The surprise attack caught the team off guard, and a fierce battle ensued.
Sorvan, piloting the advanced EX-101 Nemesis, proved to be a formidable opponent, utilizing teleportation technology and devastating energy weaponry.
The battle was brutal, with Sorvan systematically targeting the squad. Despite suffering heavy casualties, with multiple pilots being killed or incapacitated, the squad managed to bring down Sorvan’s mech, ending the fight with a nuclear explosion that nearly obliterated both the enemy and themselves.
After-Action Report: Solstice Rain
Outcome: Mission Success

With the jammers neutralized and LSA reinforcements continuing to push Sovereignty forces out of the city, the Battle of Nov Elysia soon came to an end. Sporadic pockets of Sovereignty resistance left behind during the retreat will be mopped up in the days to come. For now, the battle is over, though what has happened here may simply be the opening salvo in a much greater war.

The squad's mission was a resounding success. The jamming network was disabled, allowing the LSA to reclaim key parts of the city. The successful rescue of both the Captain and the Ambassador from the stealth submarine was a critical achievement, ensuring that vital intelligence and command personnel were not lost.

However, the squad paid a heavy price. The ambush by Colonel Sorvan resulted in the deaths of multiple pilots, with only Junkie and Cleric surviving the battle unscathed. Though Strongback, Snipershell, and Mountaintop were able to be rejuvenated through cloning, the process was not without complications. Strongback's act of sacrifice, staying with Brimstone in the face of certain death, will be remembered as an act of true heroism. Unfortunately, Brimstone's reconstitution efforts have met with unusual difficulties—Union scientists report anomalies in the process, and his return remains uncertain.

Additionally, a new mech chassis, bearing unknown markings, has appeared in the squad's hangar. The team is advised to investigate this further during their downtime before the next operation.

# Post-Mission Rewards:

The squad is granted a FULL REPAIR and another License Level (LL), bringing them to LL2. This allows access to manufacturer-specific frames other than those offered by GMS, giving them the opportunity to pilot more specialized mechs with new sets of traits and core powers. Pilots may also reallocate their talents or existing licenses during this period.
