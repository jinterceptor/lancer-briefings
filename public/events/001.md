### SUMMARY OF EVENTS
## > 01. MULTI-TARGET DEPLOYMENT

Rapid-response team CINDER SQUAD initiated a split-operation strategy to address concurrent high-priority threats to Evergreen Colony infrastructure and civilian safety:

Team Alpha (Huntsman, Outlaw, Vanisher) was deployed to track and eliminate a hostile sniper.

Team Bravo (Smokey, Ferryman, Vet) provided escort to Chief Engineer Castor Fielding for critical infrastructure work.

Both operations were launched simultaneously and executed under high-risk conditions.

## > 02. TARGET NEUTRALIZED — SNIPER ENGAGEMENT (“TRAPDOOR SPIDER”)

Team Alpha successfully located and subdued a previously unidentified sniper-class combatant. The operative, now confirmed to be Psalm, an elite HUC ranger, was captured alive during the engagement.
Psalm is currently held at Evergreen as a POW under administrator PATIENCE's jurisdiction.

With Psalm in custody, sniper attacks against Evergreen have ceased, resulting in improved militia morale and operational flexibility.

## > 03. CONVOY DEFENSE AND LANDING BOWL OPERATION (“BOWL SEASON”)

Team Bravo successfully repelled HUC combat elements during an ambush along the route to Evergreen’s flooded landing bowl.

All essential CEC engineering vehicles reached the objective intact. Fielding’s team completed installation of a long-term drainage and surveillance system.
The bowl is now fully operational, clearing the way for terrestrial landing of large offworld vessels in future deployments.

## > 04. EMERGENCY RESPONSE — CHÂU FARM (“THE HORDE”)

Upon regrouping, CINDER SQUAD was rerouted to the Châu farmstead near Liu Maize following an emergency transmission.

The squad encountered subalterns behaving erratically and a hostile signal-emitting comp/con node referred to as [THE BROADCAST].
After engaging with and destroying the unit, a partial data capture was recovered — containing command-level language linked to an entity named BEGGAR_ONE.

The Châu family was successfully extracted with no civilian casualties.

## > 05. INTERMISSION — DOWNTIME WINDOW

Following a temporary halt in direct hostilities, CINDER SQUAD personnel undertook the following non-combat operations during the extended downtime window:

Coordinated community assistance and morale-building actions within Evergreen.

Facilitated militia reorganization, including the successful implementation of a rotating watch schedule.

Executed field reconnaissance missions to investigate local fauna and HUC movement signatures.

Conducted salvage runs, equipment repairs, and tech development.

Participated in early interrogation and psychological assessment of POW Psalm, yielding limited but useful intelligence.

### STATUS UPDATE
As of this writing, Evergreen has stabilized. Civilian morale and defensive posture are improved.
Preliminary analysis of [THE BROADCAST] telemetry indicates increasing likelihood of non-human digital intrusion across local comp/con systems.
CINDER SQUAD is authorized to continue exploratory, protective, and information-gathering operations east of Evergreen.

Ongoing observation required. Further directives to follow.
