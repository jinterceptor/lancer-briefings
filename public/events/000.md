# UNS-CV Rio Grande // 2.21.5014u
The Ebro-class light carrier has seen a resurgence under the Third Committee. While smaller than full-sized carriers like the Amazon class, the Ebro-class is fast, flexible, and capable of deploying wings of fighters, bombers, or mounted chassis (specialized mechs for naval operations). These carriers are designed to be effective force-multipliers and patrol vessels, able to handle threats ranging from pirates to hostile Diasporan ships.

# Mission Context: 
Currently, the Rio Grande is stationed in orbit around Cressidium, supporting the ongoing diplomatic mission to reintegrate the planet into Union. While the major powers on Cressidium pose a limited naval threat, our role remains crucial in ensuring the mission’s success through logistical support and security.

# Daily Life Aboard the Rio Grande: 
Unlike long patrols where crew members spend time in stasis (“downtime”) and rotate into active duty (“uptime”), everyone on the Rio Grande is fully active due to our current mission. Here’s what you can expect:

# Maintenance and Drills: 
Regular upkeep of the ship and its systems is vital. You’ll participate in maintenance tasks and drills to ensure operational readiness.

# Training: 
Ongoing training sessions, including simulations and sparring practice, will keep your skills sharp and prepare you for any potential threats.

# Briefings: 
Daily briefings will keep you informed about mission updates, schedules, and any changes in the situation on Cressidium.

# Logistical Support: 
Assisting with the transport of goods, equipment, and personnel between the Rio Grande and Cressidium’s surface is a key part of our mission.

# Recreational Activities: 
Life on a naval vessel isn't all work. To maintain morale and camaraderie, the crew engages in various recreational activities:

# Games: 
Card games, chess, and Kapkat are popular pastimes. These games are a great way to unwind and build bonds with your fellow crew members.

# Media: 
Watching omninet media is a common way to relax during downtime.

# Sparring and Simulators: 
Competing in sparring practice or trying to achieve the top score on the pilot simulators offers both fun and practical training benefits.

# Your Role: 
As newly graduated mechanized chassis pilots, you’ll be at the heart of our operational capabilities. Whether it’s participating in drills, maintaining your mechs, or preparing for potential engagements, your contributions are essential to our mission’s success.

Embrace the challenges and opportunities that come with life aboard the Rio Grande. Your training has prepared you for this moment, and your dedication will ensure our collective success.

Welcome to the team, and good luck!
