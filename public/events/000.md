# To: All Responding Pilots
# Subject: Immediate Distress Response – Hercynia (Ardennes-3)

Pilots,

Thank you for volunteering to address the recent distress call from Hercynia (designated Ardennes-3) in the Atlas Line. We appreciate your prompt response, as you are currently the closest available asset. Below you will find all information Union has authorized for immediate release.

# Mission Summary

You are to deploy to Hercynia, make contact with the colony established by Landmark Colonial, and investigate the source of their distress call.
Upon stabilization of the situation, expect relief from a Union patrol group—timing subject to FTL constraints.

# Planetary Overview

Hercynia is a post-collapse site bearing significant remnants of older Second Committee operations.
Recorded hazards include unexploded ordinance, possible radioactive zones, and degraded military infrastructure.
Atmospheric conditions: Current monsoon-level storms and heavy cloud cover impede orbital surveillance and comms clarity.

# Colonial Holder

The charter for Hercynia is held by Landmark Colonial, a subsidiary of Smith-Shimano Corpro.
Your first action upon landing: present credentials to the Landmark representative (local administrative oversight at settlement “Evergreen”).
Coordinating with Landmark’s on-site authority is essential for safe cooperation and local support.
Potential Indigenous Presence

Survey data suggests possible human populations beyond Landmark’s colony.
Precise details are inconclusive, and no further confirmed intelligence is available. Exercise caution and adhere to Union’s principle of non-aggressive contact if you encounter additional inhabitants.

# Rules of Engagement

Union auxiliaries (or those operating under Union directive) are expected to:
Prioritize civilian safety and limit escalation wherever possible.
Engage hostiles only in self-defense or to protect life (per UAD Policy 18-3).
Document any discoveries of Second Committee technology or significant planetary anomalies.

# Compensation & Debrief

Authorized by the Union Administrative Department in coordination with relevant fleet offices.
Upon successful operation and arrival of the patrol group, you will be relieved and your service will be commended.
Standard Lancer protocols apply: your licenses and equipment privileges will proceed per normal rank progression.
This briefing contains the total scope of Union’s verified data on Hercynia. If new information arises in the field, you are directed to report promptly to this office or the incoming Union detachment for reassessment.

Proceed with all due caution. Our goal is to secure this colony, protect its population, and maintain Union’s guiding principles. Good luck, and safe landfall.

In service,
Administrator Haruki Adisa
Union Administrative Department
