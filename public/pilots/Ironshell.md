## DOSSIER ENTRY: Matthäus Hetzenauer AKA "Ironshell"

PILOT NAME: Matthäus Hetzenauer

Callsign: Ironshell

Service Number: SN-0021-JP-4378

Affiliation: Union Freelance Lancer

Status: Active

Clearance Level: Alpha-Lancer


## PROFILE OVERVIEW:
Matthäus Hetzenauer, operating under the callsign Ironshell, is a veteran artillery specialist whose tactical expertise has been honed through years of independent and Union-aligned operations. Known for his precision in long-range bombardment and unorthodox methods, Hetzenauer demonstrates exceptional proficiency in both ground and mech-based artillery combat. Though officially listed as a freelancer, Matthäus' skill set aligns closely with the strategic goals of Union Command.

# SERVICE RECORD:
Specialization: Long-Range Artillery, Indirect Fire Support
Combat Role: Tactical Artillery Operator
Operations: Hetzenauer has participated in multiple classified engagements, providing essential fire support during covert operations and large-scale battles. His contributions have been noted for both their effectiveness in neutralizing hardened targets and their efficiency in covering troop movements.

# KNOWN BACKGROUND:
Born on a remote industrial colony, Hetzenauer’s early years were marked by his exposure to the region’s less regulated markets and culture of self-reliance. His mechanical aptitude and fascination with heavy ordnance led him to pursue a career in artillery, first as a civilian and later in various paramilitary capacities. Union records indicate an extensive history of unregulated activity involving unauthorized procurement of military-grade equipment, particularly artillery platforms.

While under investigation for these activities, Hetzenauer was offered a conditional contract with Union Command to formalize his operations within Union’s framework. Since accepting, his performance has consistently met expectations, though his known prior affiliations with illicit networks remain under observation.

# PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE:
Hetzenauer exhibits a calm and methodical demeanor in combat, often favoring calculated, high-impact solutions over direct confrontation. Off-duty, he maintains a low profile, though records suggest a peculiar fondness for recreational activities such as turtle racing. This unassuming hobby, involving the champion performance of his pet turtle "Tank," contrasts sharply with his aggressive battlefield tactics. Hetzenauer is known for his ability to remain emotionally detached in high-stress situations, a trait that enhances his focus in artillery operations.

# EVALUATION:
Hetzenauer has been flagged for potential future leadership in artillery coordination roles. His tactical acumen, coupled with his knowledge of non-standard equipment, provides him with a unique perspective that Union has deemed valuable in specialized operations. His former illegal dealings have been considered low-priority, given the strategic benefit of his current service.

However, Union Command advises continued oversight on Ironshell’s activities and associations, as his history in black market circles may pose risks in prolonged deployments.

# RECOMMENDATION:
Maintain current status as a tactical asset. Monitor affiliations with external agents, and evaluate potential for promotion based on performance in ongoing operations.

## UNION PILOT RECONSTITUTION REPORT
Pilot ID: Matthäus Hetzenauer
Callsign: Snipershell
Date of Death: [REDACTED]
Cause of Death: Incinerated in a nuclear blast triggered by Sorvan using slip-space technology during Operation Solstice Rain.

# Reconstitution Overview:
After confirmation of death during Operation Solstice Rain, the reconstitution of Pilot Matthäus Hetzenauer was initiated per Union standard procedures. Genetic and cognitive backups were retrieved from secure Union archives. The clone body was grown and imprinted with all pertinent memories, knowledge, and skills leading up to his final cognitive upload.

# Side-Effects:
The traumatic nature of Pilot Hetzenauer's death, involving slip-space displacement and nuclear incineration, presented unique challenges during the reconstitution process. Although his cognitive imprints were fully restored, the cloning process resulted in significant physical abnormalities. His face now appears slightly deformed, with clammy, pallid skin and one eye noticeably larger than the other. These traits clearly distinguish him as vat-grown.

Despite these disfigurements, there are no significant functional impairments. However, Pilot Hetzenauer has expressed a preference for wearing a helmet at all times, likely due to discomfort with his altered appearance.

# Psychological Report:

Post-reconstitution evaluation reveals no major psychological or cognitive side effects beyond potential self-image concerns linked to his physical appearance. There is no expected negative impact on his mission performance, though the medical team will monitor for potential long-term psychological effects related to the trauma of his death and subsequent reconstitution.

Medical Officer in Charge: Dr. Elias Grant
