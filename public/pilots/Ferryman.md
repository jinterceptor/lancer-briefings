## [LANDMARK COLONIAL – PERSONNEL DOSSIER]

SUBJECT: Claire Kilkreve

CALLSIGN: Ferryman

ROLE: Colonial Liaison

AFFILIATION: Landmark Colonial; formerly associated with Union and subsidiary programs under █████████████

## BACKGROUND & ORIGINS

### Early Life

Born in the slums of Oleron, with scant parental oversight and persistent survival challenges.

Natural stealth developed as a youth out of necessity—shaped early life choices, from small thefts to larger heists.

### Influential Mentor

Met an older Pilot named Bastile, who provided mech training, basic education, and paternal guidance.

Relationship ended when Claire left Oleron; Bastile’s current whereabouts or fate are unknown.

### Education & Early Skills

Briefly attended Oleron State Academy, but academic success was largely due to hacking and data manipulation.

Gained a self-taught knack for digital infiltration, forging records, and obscuring personal history.

## RECRUITMENT & CAREER DEVELOPMENT

████████████████ Notice

Claire’s hacking proficiency and capacity to “blend in” caught the eye of a ████████ representative.

### Union Service

Served a short-term employment with Union (exact details classified or redacted), part of this work awarded full Pilot status.

### Landmark Colonial

Transitioned into Landmark’s rapid emergency response team as a data breacher, specializing in infiltration, code-breaking, and digital security.

## CURRENT ASSIGNMENT: HERCYNIA

### Liaison Role

Deployed to Hercynia to interface with external forces (Union auxiliaries, mercenaries, etc.) on Landmark’s behalf.

Tasked with coordinating mission objectives, ensuring Colonial interests are upheld, and maintaining flow of information back to Landmark.

## Skill Highlights

### Cyber Infiltration – Adept at accessing restricted systems, forging credentials, and obfuscating data.

### Covert Ops – Skilled at blending into new environments; rarely draws suspicion.

### Mech Pilot – Original training in mechs courtesy of Bastile; further refined under ███ and Colonial programs.

### Personal Notes

Maintains a cynical/realist perspective shaped by a rough upbringing; occasionally relishes the thrill of on-the-edge missions.

Identity remains compartmentalized: “Claire Kilkreve” is as much an engineered alias as it is a lived persona.

Prone to introspection and philosophical musings when left idle for extended periods (as noted in personal logs).

## RECOMMENDATIONS & OBSERVATIONS

Valuable Asset: A proven track record with data analytics, infiltration, and infiltration-based mech operations makes Claire an ideal liaison—particularly in situations needing discreet intelligence.

Monitoring Advised: Landmark Colonial management should keep periodic oversight, ensuring Claire remains aligned with corporate interests. Regular performance appraisals recommended.
