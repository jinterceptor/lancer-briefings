## DOSSIER ENTRY: Barsby Samson AKA "Junkie"

**Name**: Barsby Samson  

**Callsign**: Junkie  

**Service Number**: SN-0021-JP-4378 

**Affiliation**: Scythe Company  

**Role**: Lancer Pilot  

**Status**: Active  

# Profile Overview  
Junkie is a highly skilled and unorthodox pilot within Scythe Company, known for his exceptional performance in high-adrenaline combat situations. Despite his claims of never piloting a mech before the Academy, his combat ranks and experience tell a different story. Though officially part of Union’s ranks, his background remains murky, with numerous ties to illegal activities, including several instances of piracy. While he denies direct involvement, referring to himself as a 'Spacer' rather than a 'Pirate,' Union records link him to three Void Piracy incidents. One such operation involved another member of Scythe Company, though details remain classified. Junkie’s survival instincts, paired with his adrenaline-driven approach to combat, make him a formidable asset, albeit one prone to disregarding regulations when they conflict with his need for excitement.

# Service Record
- Enlisted with Scythe Company after his recruitment into the Lancer program.  
- Rapidly advanced in combat ranks due to his exceptional piloting under fire.  
- Participated in various high-risk missions, excelling in fast-paced, chaotic environments where improvisation and quick thinking were key.  
- Records indicate involvement in 3 Void Piracy operations against IPS-N and other manufacturers, though formal charges have not been filed.  

# Known Background
Barsby Samson, known by his callsign ‘Junkie,’ is an ex-spacer with a history of operating in the void, where he and his crew allegedly conducted raids on corporate entities. Though Junkie refers to these as “opportunistic raids,” Union intelligence views them as acts of piracy. The fate of his former crew remains unknown, and no records have confirmed what became of them. Barsby is the only confirmed survivor, and his past remains a point of suspicion. Despite the cloud surrounding his early years, Junkie has adapted remarkably well to life as a Lancer pilot, proving himself an indispensable member of Scythe Company.  

# Psychological Profile
Junkie exhibits a strong need for high-intensity, high-risk scenarios, often seeking out adrenaline-fueled situations regardless of the potential consequences. His crass demeanor and disregard for formal procedures are matched by a deep disdain for tasks he deems mundane. Nevertheless, when engaged in combat, Junkie demonstrates an acute focus, operating with precision and efficiency that suggests extensive prior experience. His need for danger is coupled with a streak of pragmatism; he is well aware of his own limitations and seems willing to push them when necessary. While reckless at times, Junkie’s tactical instincts are sharp, allowing him to make split-second decisions in life-threatening circumstances. His motivation for joining Scythe Company and fighting for Union remains unclear, though he appears driven by a desire to prove himself, both to his superiors and to his past.

# Evaluation
Junkie is a wildcard, but one who thrives under pressure. His skills as a pilot are undeniable, though his attitude toward authority can create tension within the chain of command. His record shows that he works best when given autonomy, and his disregard for bureaucratic obstacles suggests he may be better suited for irregular operations where improvisation is valued over strict adherence to protocol. His history with Void Piracy and his connection to other Scythe Company members raise concerns about his loyalty, but his performance in the field has consistently shown his commitment to the team.

# Recommendation
Barsby ‘Junkie’ Samson should continue to be deployed in combat scenarios that emphasize mobility, adaptability, and high-stakes engagements. His psychological profile suggests that prolonged periods of inactivity or assignments requiring rigid structure could lead to friction within the unit. Any missions requiring fast-strike tactics, covert insertion, or unconventional warfare are ideal for his skill set. However, given his history and temperament, Junkie should be closely monitored to ensure his actions remain in line with Union directives. His past involvement in piracy, while unresolved, makes him a liability if not properly managed.
