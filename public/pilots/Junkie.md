Argh!!! when is this going to start?!.. what?.. 10m ago? huh... 

Well, I am  Barsby Samson, also known as Junkie yada yada yada. 

I'm here for the rush. No more, no less. So, as long as I'm not doing anything Boooring, I'm good. I don't really care what I'm fighting for or who I'm fighting against. See, I'm a spacer... or was..? Look, what matters is that the ship I was raised on is dead and I'm not.

In combat I prefer to get nice and close. The Rush you feel closing the gap with rounds flying past and the Satisfying Clang you get hitting some poor Bastards, hahaha!

Besides that I don't give a shit.
