# Known Background
Shi Qi, callsign Cleric, comes from a family with deep roots in corporate management on a sprawling city-planet. His early life was one of privilege, with the expectation that he would follow in his family's footsteps. However, Cleric's fascination with engineering, particularly in weapons systems, drew him away from this path. His career began in a ship design company where he honed his skills, but the routine nature of the work quickly became stifling. Determined to avoid a life of mediocrity, Cleric abandoned his position and joined the ranks of Lancers, seeing combat as a way to apply his talents in more meaningful and exciting ways.

## Psychological Profile

His methodical and detail-oriented personality makes him a natural engineer, but his growing dissatisfaction with routine led him to seek more dynamic outlets for his skills. In combat, Cleric is deliberate and analytical, often taking time to assess a situation before engaging. This can sometimes be mistaken for hesitance, but it stems from his desire to maximize efficiency. While typically calm and composed, Cleric harbors a strong drive to prove himself, particularly in situations where his technical expertise is on the line. His background as an engineer gives him a unique perspective in battle, often allowing him to identify and exploit mechanical weaknesses in enemy systems.

# Evaluation
Cleric is a highly competent Lancer with a strong foundation in engineering and technical design. His contributions to the team extend beyond combat, as his modifications and maintenance of mechs make him an invaluable asset to Scythe Company. His cautious, calculated approach to combat aligns well with missions that require precision and planning, though he may struggle in high-intensity, chaotic environments. His desire to prove himself suggests he will continue to grow and refine his skills, making him a long-term asset for the team.

# Recommendation
Cleric should continue to be deployed in missions where his technical expertise can be utilized to its fullest extent. His ability to maintain and upgrade equipment will be critical to Scythe Companyâ€™s long-term success. Given his potential for rapid improvement, he should be encouraged to take on more leadership roles in technical operations, while continuing to develop his combat instincts. His engineering background should be leveraged for field modifications and tactical innovations.
