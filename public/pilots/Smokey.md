## [UNION ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT | PERSONNEL DOSSIER]

SUBJECT: Winona Friesz

CALLSIGN: SMOKEY

AGE: Mid-50s

AFFILIATION: Union Lancer Pilot

SPECIALIZATION: Harrison Armory Cybernetic Augmentation

ASSIGNMENT: Acting Squad Leader, Hercynia Rapid-Response

## BACKGROUND & SERVICE RECORD

Origin: Born on Varkana, an Outer Systems world that initially rejected Union influence before its leadership chose peaceful annexation.

Early Life: Grew up in a self-sufficient, fiercely independent environment. Influenced by Varkana’s cultural narrative of resisting outside control. Joined the Free Varkana Movement, a militant faction opposing Union’s integration.

Catastrophic Incident: Participated in a bombing intended to target Union-aligned facilities, resulting in numerous civilian deaths. Severely injured in the explosion: extensive trauma, limb loss, and near-fatal burns. Rescued and reconstructed under Union’s medical oversight, with Harrison Armory providing advanced cybernetics.

Redemption & Service: Profoundly impacted by Union’s mercy. Renounced extremist ideology. Spent 30+ years serving Union as a Lancer, demonstrating notable loyalty and commitment to Union mandates despite a checkered past.

## PSYCHOLOGICAL/ETHICAL PROFILE

Personality: Often chipper, upbeat, using humor and casual banter to cope with guilt and trauma.

Inner Conflict: Wrestles with the memory of his actions on Varkana. Driven by atonement and an unwavering desire to prove his dedication to Union’s cause.

Family & Personal Ties: Married to Dr. Helena Orlan-Friesz (Union field surgeon instrumental in his recovery). Father to Elias “Eli” Friesz, a perceptive teenager who questions authority and challenges Winona’s conviction in Union.

## CYBERNETIC AUGMENTATIONS

Harrison Armory Reconstruction: Extensive prosthetics, integrated with advanced neural and musculoskeletal interface systems. Allows above-average mobility, reflexes, and resilience. Carries psychological weight—Winona’s modifications are a tangible reminder of both Union’s mercy and his former Free Varkana actions.

## CURRENT ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES

Squad Leader, Hercynia Rapid-Response

Appointed by Union to coordinate joint-operations on Hercynia. Responsible for managing auxiliary Union assets, corporate contractors, and mercenary teams. Expected to uphold Union’s Rules of Engagement, ensuring minimal civilian harm and fair cooperation with local authorities.

## Operational Directives:

Stabilize the distress call area (Evergreen colony). Maintain chain of command under Union oversight, guiding non-Union operators (e.g., Landmark Colonial, Mirrorsmoke Mercenaries). Provide diplomatic and combat leadership while balancing the complexities of Hercynia’s situation.

## Performance Notes:

Exhibits exemplary field discipline post-recovery. Strong empathic drive can lead to overexertion or personal risk if he feels responsible for others’ safety. Demonstrates a highly cooperative approach—potentially effective in bridging tensions between factions.

## RELEVANT CAUTIONS

Emotional Stress: Subject’s past trauma may resurface under intense conflict, particularly when confronting insurgent actions or civilian risk.

Personal Ideological Sensitivity: Deep loyalty to Union may override caution if he fears repeating old mistakes; watch for signs of self-sacrificial tendencies.
