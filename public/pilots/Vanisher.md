## [UNION ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT | PERSONNEL DOSSIER]

SUBJECT: Don “Donald” Hersher

CALLSIGN: VANISHER

AFFILIATION: Far-Field Research Team, Union Economic Bureau

CURRENT DEPLOYMENT: Rapid-Response Relief Operation, Hercynia

## BACKGROUND & SERVICE RECORD

Origin: Recently attached to a Union Far-Field research team dedicated to surveying potential development sites under the Union Economic Bureau.

Experience: First major off-world posting; relatively green regarding frontline conditions.
Familiar with time-dilation and multi-system travel as part of standard far-field duty but still adjusting to real-time operations in the Atlas Line.

Personal Motivations: Sees team members as surrogate family, deeply loyal and protective toward fellow personnel. Left behind close ties from Cradle and earlier assignments; driven by both wanderlust and a desire to uphold Union’s mission of exploration.

## DEPLOYMENT HISTORY

Prior Assignment: Conducting planetary surveys near Hercynia when the colony’s distress call was received.

Reason for Redeployment: Recommended as best candidate for direct engagement due to emergent conflict at Evergreen. Selected to bolster the QRF in orbit over Hercynia, bridging research expertise with combat readiness.

## COMBAT FRAME PROFICIENCY

Existing Experience: Sagmartha-class chassis pilot at time of redeployment.

Napoleon Frame: Courted for potential transition to a Napoleon mech; thus far demonstrates the flexibility needed to operate heavier or specialized frames.

Operational Note: Technically adept from field research, but lacks deep combat history—training and on-site mentorship recommended upon initial engagements.

## RELEVANT SKILLS & CHARACTERISTICS

Analytical Mindset: Equipped for survey and reconnaissance; likely to excel at identifying resource nodes, hazard sites, and strategic vantage points.

Adaptive Temperament: Quick to acclimate to new environments, reflective of Far-Field departmental cross-planetary experience.

Protective Instinct: Shows a strong sense of comradeship—loyal in the face of adversity, especially toward new squadmates.

## CURRENT STATUS

Location: Aboard QRF transport in low orbit over Hercynia, awaiting Union and/or Joint Ops directives.

## Immediate Objectives:

Integrate with new response team.

Provide field reconnaissance and combat support as directed by mission lead.

Uphold Union’s ROE (prioritizing civilian safety and intelligence-gathering).
