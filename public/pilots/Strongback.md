## DOSSIER ENTRY: Sleve McDichael AKA "Strongback"

**Name**: Sleve McDichael

**Callsign**: Strongback

**Service Number**: SN-0045-XC-1289

**Affiliation**: Scythe Company

**Role**: Lancer Pilot

**Status**: Active

# Profile Overview
Strongback is a former salvage operator who was thrust into the world of Lancers after a devastating raid left him the sole survivor of his crew. A man of simple tastes and strong work ethic, Sleve McDichael built a career around hard labor, but the destruction of his crew at the hands of raiders pushed him into a new path. Surviving the raid by sheer willpower, Strongback made it off the ruined ship and swore to fight back against those who had wronged him. Now, as a Lancer, he brings the same dogged persistence and raw strength to the battlefield that had once kept him alive in the harshest environments. His name, Strongback, reflects both his physical endurance and his mental resilience.

# Service Record
- Former salvage operator, working in deep space for several cycles.
- Only survivor of a raider attack that wiped out his entire crew.
- Joined Lancer forces to seek vengeance and forge a new path in life.
- Known for his physical toughness and a relentless approach to combat, often operating in heavy-duty salvage mechs.

# Known Background
Sleve McDichael spent years as a salvage operator, living a simple but rewarding life as part of a small crew. His quiet existence was shattered when a group of raiders attacked, killing his team and leaving him stranded on a broken ship. Barely surviving the ordeal, Strongback managed to cobble together enough of a ship to make it back to civilization. From that point on, he knew that if the galaxy was going to push him into chaos, he would fight back with all his might. After joining the Lancers, Strongback put his skills with heavy machinery and salvage mechs to use in a more combative environment, where his resilience and determination have made him a force to be reckoned with.

# Psychological Profile
Strongback is a man of few words and simple motivations. He values hard work, loyalty, and perseverance, and these traits have served him well both in his old life and in his new career as a Lancer. The loss of his crew has left a lasting impact on him, manifesting in a desire for revenge and a burning need to prove his strength. In combat, Strongback is relentless, willing to take hits and push forward even when others might falter. His practical, no-nonsense attitude makes him a reliable team member, though his single-minded focus on vengeance can sometimes blind him to alternative strategies. Despite this, his sheer toughness and unyielding willpower make him a formidable opponent.

# Evaluation
Strongback’s experience with salvage operations and his ability to operate in harsh, unforgiving environments translate well into his role as a Lancer. His capacity to endure hardship and press on through adversity is his greatest asset, making him a natural fit for missions that require staying power and resilience. While his focus on revenge can be a double-edged sword, it also gives him the drive needed to see his objectives through to the end.

# Recommendation
Strongback should continue to be deployed in roles that require heavy lifting, durability, and long-term survival in difficult conditions. His resilience makes him a key player in extended operations, and his ability to operate in salvage conditions could be valuable in recovery and repair missions. While his thirst for vengeance should be monitored, it also provides a strong motivator that can be harnessed effectively if channeled properly.

## OPERATION: SOLSTICE RAIN DEBRIEFING

**Pilot**: Sleve McDichael (Strongback)

**Service Number**: SN-0045-XC-1289

**Status**: Reconstituted

# Summary of Actions:
Strongback exhibited steadfast loyalty and selflessness in the final moments of the operation. After attempting to rescue Brimstone from his damaged mech, he chose to stay by his side even as the catastrophic meltdown of his own mech loomed. Both pilots were killed in the resulting nuclear explosion.

# Notable Events:
- Took a key role in heavy support and reinforcement during critical moments in the mission.
- Stayed with Brimstone in his final moments, choosing to share his fate rather than leave him behind.
- Reconstituted with full cybernetic limb replacements due to the nature of his vaporization.

# Performance Evaluation:
Strongback’s actions highlight his unwavering loyalty and commitment to his squad. His sacrifice, while heroic, underscores the importance of careful planning in high-risk scenarios. His reconstitution has left him feeling something is missing, a psychological effect that should be monitored closely.

## UNION PILOT RECONSTITUTION REPORT

**Pilot ID**: Sleve McDichael

**Callsign**: Strongback

**Date of Death**: [REDACTED]

**Cause of Death**: Catastrophic nuclear detonation during Operation: Solstice Rain. Pilot McDichael perished alongside Pilot Guang Fu Gathright (callsign: Brimstone) when Strongback’s mech suffered a catastrophic meltdown. McDichael chose to remain in the blast radius to aid his trapped comrade, resulting in mutual annihilation.

# Reconstitution Overview:
Following the confirmed deaths of Pilot McDichael and Pilot Gathright, reconstitution protocols were initiated. Genetic and cognitive backups for McDichael were retrieved from Union archives; however, due to the total vaporization of his body in the nuclear event, the cloning process presented significant challenges.

Union reconstitution facilities were able to recover McDichael’s cognitive data without issue, but due to the severity of his physical obliteration, his body was only able to be reconstructed up to the torso. As a result, all four of Pilot McDichael’s limbs have been replaced with advanced cybernetics. These enhancements meet Union’s highest operational standards, but the sudden reliance on artificial limbs has led to some adjustment difficulties.

Interestingly, the event leading to McDichael’s death—along with the decision to remain within the blast radius—has been flagged as potentially para-causal in nature. Subtle inconsistencies and data corruption in mission logs, alongside pilot reports, have raised questions about the exact nature of the incident. However, there is no clear evidence, and Union records show all events proceeding as expected. McDichael himself retains only fragmented memories of the final moments with Brimstone.

# Side-Effects:
In addition to the cybernetic limbs, McDichael has reported a persistent, unshakeable feeling that “something is missing.” Despite the absence of physical impairments, he describes a sense of incompleteness or disconnection, particularly regarding his actions leading up to his death. He has not been able to fully articulate or quantify this feeling.

His reconstituted body has fully integrated with the cybernetic prosthetics, which have enhanced his physical strength and durability in the field. Nonetheless, the sudden transition to a fully cybernetic limb system has led to minor motor control issues that have since been resolved through post-reconstitution therapy and adaptation training.

# Psychological Report:
Psychological evaluations show no significant cognitive degradation, though Pilot McDichael has shown mild signs of emotional distress connected to the incident. His decision to remain in the blast radius to aid Brimstone has led to some internal conflict—while he feels he acted honorably, there is a lingering sense of ambiguity around the event itself.

Pilot McDichael has expressed concerns that his death may have been tied to something larger than a simple malfunction, though he is unable to explain this intuition. His performance in training exercises post-reconstitution remains unaffected, and despite these unresolved concerns, McDichael maintains high operational readiness.

It is recommended that the medical team continue to monitor for psychological effects related to his death and ongoing adjustment to cybernetic integration.

**Medical Officer in Charge**: Dr. Elias Grant

**Approval Status**: Cleared for Active Duty

# This report is to be maintained in Pilot Sleve McDichael's personnel file for future reference, with a specific note on the para-causal nature of his death and the need for further observation regarding his psychological and cybernetic integration.
