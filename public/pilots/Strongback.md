**Service Number**: SN-0045-XC-1289

# Profile Overview
Strongback is a former salvage operator who was thrust into the world of Lancers after a devastating raid left him the sole survivor of his crew. A man of simple tastes and strong work ethic, Sleve McDichael built a career around hard labor, but the destruction of his crew at the hands of raiders pushed him into a new path. Surviving the raid by sheer willpower, Strongback made it off the ruined ship and swore to fight back against those who had wronged him. Now, as a Lancer, he brings the same dogged persistence and raw strength to the battlefield that had once kept him alive in the harshest environments. His name, Strongback, reflects both his physical endurance and his mental resilience.

# Service Record
- Former salvage operator, working in deep space for several cycles.
- Only survivor of a raider attack that wiped out his entire crew.
- Joined Lancer forces to seek vengeance and forge a new path in life.
- Known for his physical toughness and a relentless approach to combat, often operating in heavy-duty salvage mechs.

# Known Background
Sleve McDichael spent years as a salvage operator, living a simple but rewarding life as part of a small crew. His quiet existence was shattered when a group of raiders attacked, killing his team and leaving him stranded on a broken ship. Barely surviving the ordeal, Strongback managed to cobble together enough of a ship to make it back to civilization. From that point on, he knew that if the galaxy was going to push him into chaos, he would fight back with all his might. After joining the Lancers, Strongback put his skills with heavy machinery and salvage mechs to use in a more combative environment, where his resilience and determination have made him a force to be reckoned with.

# Psychological Profile
Strongback is a man of few words and simple motivations. He values hard work, loyalty, and perseverance, and these traits have served him well both in his old life and in his new career as a Lancer. The loss of his crew has left a lasting impact on him, manifesting in a desire for revenge and a burning need to prove his strength. In combat, Strongback is relentless, willing to take hits and push forward even when others might falter. His practical, no-nonsense attitude makes him a reliable team member, though his single-minded focus on vengeance can sometimes blind him to alternative strategies. Despite this, his sheer toughness and unyielding willpower make him a formidable opponent.

# Evaluation
Strongback’s experience with salvage operations and his ability to operate in harsh, unforgiving environments translate well into his role as a Lancer. His capacity to endure hardship and press on through adversity is his greatest asset, making him a natural fit for missions that require staying power and resilience. While his focus on revenge can be a double-edged sword, it also gives him the drive needed to see his objectives through to the end.

# Recommendation
Strongback should continue to be deployed in roles that require heavy lifting, durability, and long-term survival in difficult conditions. His resilience makes him a key player in extended operations, and his ability to operate in salvage conditions could be valuable in recovery and repair missions. While his thirst for vengeance should be monitored, it also provides a strong motivator that can be harnessed effectively if channeled properly.
