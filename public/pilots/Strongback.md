Sleve McDichael is a simple man. Mount up, complete his hard week's worth of salvage operations, and then take his rest. He'd done that for cycle after cycle, carving himself out a comfortable role among his team. 

That was, until raiders slaughtered his crewmates, and left him for dead, on the far side of the Monma System. 

Of course, after so many years of labor, he'd developed a thicker skin than most, and he dragged his broken body to the last salvage frame. Making it back to what was left of their ship, he made it off world, and after patching himself up, he'd put in a course for the nearest Lancer recruitment center. 

If the 'verse wanted to drag him into the fire, so be it. He'd fire right back, and he'd take those fucking raiders with him.

## Union NHP Division: Reconstitution and Cloning Report

# Pilot Designation: Strongback
# Legal Name: Sleve McDichael
# Pilot License Number: 5774-AZ-349-10
# Unit Assignment: Scythe Company

## RECONSTITUTION REPORT

# Date of Incident: 09/05/2024
# Location: Battle of Nov Elysia, Operation Solstice Rain
# Nature of Death: Pilot Strongback (Sleve McDichael) was caught in a catastrophic detonation caused by the enemy mech of Sorvan. Strongback’s body was vaporized in the ensuing blast.

## RECONSTITUTION DETAILS

# Cloning Date: 09/07/2024
# Cloning ID: CR-993-5437
# Reconstitution Facility: Union NHP Advanced Cloning, Sector 7

## NOTABLE SIDE EFFECTS:

# Cybernetic Replacement: Due to the total vaporization of Strongback’s body except for the head and torso, the cloning process was only able to generate the upper half of his body. All limbs have been replaced with advanced cybernetic prosthetics. These prosthetics are top-of-the-line, allowing for seamless integration with remaining organic tissues, although they require routine maintenance and recalibration.

## RECONSTITUTION STATUS: SUCCESSFUL (Partial organic reconstruction with significant cybernetic augmentation)

# Union Lead Specialist: Dr. Samuel Gredith
# Union Neuropsych Division Officer: Dr. Ella Kanis
