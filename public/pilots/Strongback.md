Sleve McDichael is a simple man. Mount up, complete his hard week's worth of salvage operations, and then take his rest. He'd done that for cycle after cycle, carving himself out a comfortable role among his team. That was, until raiders slaughtered his crewmates, and left him for dead, on the far side of the Monma System. Of course, after so many years of labor, he'd developed a thicker skin than most, and he dragged his broken body to the last salvage frame. Making it back to what was left of their ship, he made it off world, and after patching himself up, he'd put in a course for the nearest Lancer recruitment center. If the 'verse wanted to drag him into the fire, so be it. He'd fire right back, and he'd take those fucking raiders with him.
