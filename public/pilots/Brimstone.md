# Profile Overview
Brimstone, or Brim for short, is a methodical and tactically-minded mercenary who has worked his way up through the ranks of hired guns in the outer territories. Born far from the influence of core worlds, Brimstone has spent his career operating for lesser-known conglomerates, planetary rulers, and private enterprises, executing contracts for a living. His lack of a consistent patron or large backing has not deterred him. Instead, he has climbed the ladder from low-level jobs to affording his first licensed mech, marking a significant milestone in his career. Now part of Scythe Company, he aims to further his reputation while maintaining his preference for well-planned and cautious operations. Brimstone believes that success lies in preparation and patience, a mindset that has kept him alive thus far.

# Service Record
- Began his career taking low-level mercenary jobs in outer systems.
- Gained enough experience and resources to afford his first licensed mech.
- Noted for preferring tactical planning over impulsive actions.
- Recruited into Scythe Company, where he continues to establish his reputation as a dependable Lancer.

# Known Background
- Guang Fu Gathright, callsign Brimstone, hails from the fringes of developed space. His mercenary career began with small-scale jobs, largely in the employ of minor corporations and planetary barons. Without a stable sponsor, Brimstone forged his own path, slowly ascending through the ranks until he earned enough to become a fully licensed Lancer. His background remains largely unremarkable compared to his current position, though his persistence and ambition set him apart from other independent contractors. Brimstone prefers a low-profile lifestyle, seeking to accumulate resources and reputation without drawing unnecessary attention.

# Psychological Profile
Brimstone is pragmatic, cautious, and tactically minded. He is patient, willing to wait for the right moment to strike, and tends to avoid high-risk, rash decisions. His measured approach to both combat and life has earned him a reputation for reliability, though some perceive him as overly conservative in his methods. His laid-back demeanor hides a strong desire to survive and thrive in a dangerous profession. While new to mech combat, Brimstone’s history of hand-to-hand fighting and tactical decision-making makes him a versatile operator. His calculated nature contrasts with the high-risk behavior of some other pilots, but it ensures he maintains a sharp focus on the bigger picture.

# Evaluation
Brimstone’s steady, disciplined approach to combat makes him a valuable member of Scythe Company, particularly in operations requiring precision and strategic planning. His reluctance to rush into conflict aligns well with missions that demand patience and forethought, though he may struggle in scenarios requiring quick, instinctual decisions. His relative inexperience with mechs, compared to other Lancers, is offset by his tactical instincts. Given proper mentorship and time, Brimstone has the potential to excel in his new role.

# Recommendation
Brimstone should continue to be assigned to operations requiring calculated decision-making and deliberate action. His ability to assess risks and avoid unnecessary danger makes him ideal for missions where tactical planning is critical. While his cautious nature may not always align with the more impulsive pilots in Scythe Company, his disciplined approach offers a valuable balance to the team. He should be encouraged to further hone his mech combat skills, allowing his natural leadership abilities to shine through.
