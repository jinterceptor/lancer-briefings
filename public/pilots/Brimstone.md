## DOSSIER ENTRY: Guan Fu Gathright AKA "Brimstone"

Guang Fu Gathright, otherwise know as callsign Brimstone, is a gun for hire. Operating away from the general influence of core worlds Brimstone makes his money operating for the various conglomerates, companies and barons of the lesser developed worlds to make a living. without a real large backing or patron Brimstone has worked his way up from low level jobs to finally being able to afford his first licensed mech and doesn't plan on stopping. small beginnings but big plans and no one will get in his way.

Brimstone or Brim for short prefers a more tactical and thought through plan of action. "you cant survive without a plan and rushing in without one is a sure fire way of leaping into an early grave". you don't make your way to the top by making rash decisions. a farily laid back merc trying to establish himself he has seen his fair share of hand to hand fighting but as a brand new lancer mech combat may make or break him.
