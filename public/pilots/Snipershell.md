## UNION PILOT RECONSTITUTION REPORT

# Pilot ID: Matthäus Hetzenauer
# Callsign: Snipershell
# Date of Death: [REDACTED]
# Cause of Death: Incinerated in a nuclear blast triggered by Sorvan using slip-space technology during Operation Solstice Rain.

## Reconstitution Overview:

# After confirmation of death during Operation Solstice Rain, the reconstitution of Pilot Matthäus Hetzenauer was initiated per Union standard procedures. Genetic and cognitive backups were retrieved from secure Union archives. The clone body was grown and imprinted with all pertinent memories, knowledge, and skills leading up to his final cognitive upload.

## Side-Effects:

# The traumatic nature of Pilot Hetzenauer's death, involving slip-space displacement and nuclear incineration, presented unique challenges during the reconstitution process. Although his cognitive imprints were fully restored, the cloning process resulted in significant physical abnormalities. His face now appears slightly deformed, with clammy, pallid skin and one eye noticeably larger than the other. These traits clearly distinguish him as vat-grown.

# Despite these disfigurements, there are no significant functional impairments. However, Pilot Hetzenauer has expressed a preference for wearing a helmet at all times, likely due to discomfort with his altered appearance.

## Psychological Report:

# Post-reconstitution evaluation reveals no major psychological or cognitive side effects beyond potential self-image concerns linked to his physical appearance. There is no expected negative impact on his mission performance, though the medical team will monitor for potential long-term psychological effects related to the trauma of his death and subsequent reconstitution.

# Medical Officer in Charge: Dr. Elias Grant
# Approval Status: Cleared for Active Duty

# This report is to be maintained in Pilot Matthäus Hetzenauer's personnel file for future reference concerning his reconstitution history and any necessary medical follow-ups.
