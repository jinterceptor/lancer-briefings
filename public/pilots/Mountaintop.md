**Name**: Josh Batrich

**Callsign**: Mountaintop

**Service Number**: SN-0034-KL-8763

**Affiliation**: Scythe Company

**Role**: Lancer Pilot

**Status**: Active

# Profile Overview
Mountaintop is a former ISP-N security officer turned Lancer, known for his heavily armored and defensive playstyle. His career began as part of ISP-N's anti-piracy patrols, but an early experience with a pirate raid left him shaken and eventually led to his dismissal from the company. Despite this setback, Mountaintop's fascination with Lancers and the thrill of battle inspired him to become a pilot. Now, as a member of Scythe Company, he has become known for his resilience and preference for overwhelming firepower and defense. He earned his callsign as a nod to his preferred GMS Everest frame and his solid, immovable nature in combat.

# Service Record
- Former security officer for ISP-N anti-piracy patrols.
- Dismissed following a traumatic experience during a pirate raid.
- Obtained his Lancer license and joined Scythe Company, quickly becoming known for his defensive combat style.
- Specialized in heavy armor and firepower, often taking on roles that require a strong, immovable presence on the battlefield.

# Known Background
Josh Batrich’s career began with what he believed would be a relatively easy position in ISP-N’s anti-piracy patrols, expecting to spend most of his time in core space, away from real danger. However, during his first assignment, his convoy was ambushed by pirates. The sight of Lancers boarding the ship sent him into a panic, and he hid during the attack. Though the ship was eventually secured, Josh’s failure to act led to his dismissal. Determined to redeem himself, he pursued a career as a Lancer, inspired by the same combat machines that had once terrified him. Now, he operates with a focus on defense, ensuring that he is never caught unprepared again.

# Psychological Profile
Mountaintop exhibits a deep-seated need for security and control, traits that likely stem from his traumatic early experiences with piracy. His preference for heavily armored frames and overwhelming firepower reflects this mindset; he wants to ensure that he has the upper hand in any conflict. Despite his rough start, Mountaintop has grown into a reliable and steady pilot, capable of holding the line under immense pressure. He is known for his calm, measured responses in combat, often acting as the foundation around which his team operates. While he still occasionally struggles with anxiety in high-stress situations, his commitment to improving and his desire to protect others drive him to push through these challenges.

# Evaluation
Mountaintop is a solid, dependable pilot who excels in defensive and support roles. His experience with ISP-N and his personal growth since his dismissal have made him a resilient and determined operator. While he lacks the aggressive tendencies of some of his peers, his defensive tactics provide a necessary balance to Scythe Company’s more offensive-minded members. Mountaintop’s ability to absorb damage and maintain battlefield presence makes him an indispensable part of the team.

# Recommendation
Mountaintop should continue to be assigned to missions where a strong defensive presence is required. His ability to withstand pressure and his steady, composed nature make him a valuable asset in protracted engagements. Encouragement and opportunities to develop his leadership potential should be considered, as his calm demeanor could serve him well in command roles.

## UNION PILOT RECONSTITUTION REPORT

**Pilot ID**: Josh Batrich

**Callsign**: Mountaintop

**Date of Death**: [REDACTED]

**Cause of Death**: Fatal injuries sustained during Operation Solstice Rain after direct engagement with hostile Lancers.

# Reconstitution Overview:
Following the confirmation of death during Operation Solstice Rain, Union initiated the reconstitution process for Pilot Josh Batrich, utilizing preserved genetic and cognitive backups. The standard cloning procedures were followed, growing a new body and implanting his final cognitive upload to restore all pertinent memories, skills, and knowledge.

Although the procedure was deemed successful, Mountaintop has repeatedly reported a persistent auditory disturbance—a voice in his head that he claims gives unsolicited advice and commentary during combat situations. Union medical officers have found no physical anomalies in the clone’s neural or cognitive systems, though the exact cause of these hallucinations remains undetermined.

# Side-Effects:
Beyond the auditory hallucinations, no significant physical defects have been identified in Pilot Batrich’s new body. Cognitive function remains sharp, and motor skills are unaffected. Union psychological evaluations have noted his growing frustration with the "voice," but he remains in control and displays no signs of instability.

The persistent voice has led Pilot Batrich to experience moderate anxiety during off-duty hours, though this has not yet impacted his combat performance. Union does not have any indication of foreign code or digital infection but will continue to monitor for irregularities in his behavioral patterns.

# Psychological Report:
While Pilot Batrich's psychological evaluation shows no major degradation in cognitive function or combat readiness, the reports of auditory hallucinations have raised concerns among medical staff. Union’s team will continue to monitor Mountaintop for any escalation of these symptoms.

It is worth noting that Mountaintop has developed coping mechanisms to handle the voice, which currently manifests only as mild interference during non-combat operations. His personality otherwise remains intact, with no evidence of lingering trauma beyond this quirk.

**Medical Officer in Charge**: Dr. Elias Grant

**Approval Status**: Cleared for Active Duty, with continued monitoring for auditory disturbances.

# This report is to be maintained in Pilot Josh Batrich's personnel file for future reference concerning his reconstitution history and any necessary medical follow-ups.
