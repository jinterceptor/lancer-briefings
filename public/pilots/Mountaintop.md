**Role**: Lancer Pilot

**Status**: Active

# Profile Overview
Mountaintop is a former ISP-N security officer turned Lancer, known for his heavily armored and defensive playstyle. His career began as part of ISP-N's anti-piracy patrols, but an early experience with a pirate raid left him shaken and eventually led to his dismissal from the company. Despite this setback, Mountaintop's fascination with Lancers and the thrill of battle inspired him to become a pilot. Now, as a member of Scythe Company, he has become known for his resilience and preference for overwhelming firepower and defense. He earned his callsign as a nod to his preferred GMS Everest frame and his solid, immovable nature in combat.

# Service Record
- Former security officer for ISP-N anti-piracy patrols.
- Dismissed following a traumatic experience during a pirate raid.
- Obtained his Lancer license and joined Scythe Company, quickly becoming known for his defensive combat style.
- Specialized in heavy armor and firepower, often taking on roles that require a strong, immovable presence on the battlefield.

# Known Background
Josh Batrich’s career began with what he believed would be a relatively easy position in ISP-N’s anti-piracy patrols, expecting to spend most of his time in core space, away from real danger. However, during his first assignment, his convoy was ambushed by pirates. The sight of Lancers boarding the ship sent him into a panic, and he hid during the attack. Though the ship was eventually secured, Josh’s failure to act led to his dismissal. Determined to redeem himself, he pursued a career as a Lancer, inspired by the same combat machines that had once terrified him. Now, he operates with a focus on defense, ensuring that he is never caught unprepared again.

# Psychological Profile
Mountaintop exhibits a deep-seated need for security and control, traits that likely stem from his traumatic early experiences with piracy. His preference for heavily armored frames and overwhelming firepower reflects this mindset; he wants to ensure that he has the upper hand in any conflict. Despite his rough start, Mountaintop has grown into a reliable and steady pilot, capable of holding the line under immense pressure. He is known for his calm, measured responses in combat, often acting as the foundation around which his team operates. While he still occasionally struggles with anxiety in high-stress situations, his commitment to improving and his desire to protect others drive him to push through these challenges.

# Evaluation
Mountaintop is a solid, dependable pilot who excels in defensive and support roles. His experience with ISP-N and his personal growth since his dismissal have made him a resilient and determined operator. While he lacks the aggressive tendencies of some of his peers, his defensive tactics provide a necessary balance to Scythe Company’s more offensive-minded members. Mountaintop’s ability to absorb damage and maintain battlefield presence makes him an indispensable part of the team.

# Recommendation
Mountaintop should continue to be assigned to missions where a strong defensive presence is required. His ability to withstand pressure and his steady, composed nature make him a valuable asset in protracted engagements. Encouragement and opportunities to develop his leadership potential should be considered, as his calm demeanor could serve him well in command roles.

## UNION PILOT RECONSTITUTION REPORT

**Pilot ID**: Matthäus Hetzenauer

**Callsign**: Ironshell

**Service Number**: SN-0021-JP-4378

**Date of Death**: [REDACTED]

**Cause of Death**: Incinerated in a nuclear blast triggered by Col. Sorvan during a slip-space self-erasure event in Operation Solstice Rain.

# Reconstitution Overview:
After confirmation of death during Operation Solstice Rain, Pilot Matthäus Hetzenauer, callsign "Ironshell," was approved for reconstitution. Genetic and cognitive backups were retrieved from secure Union archives. His clone body was grown and successfully imprinted with his memories, knowledge, and combat skills, preserving his performance profile.

However, due to the extreme nature of his death in a nuclear blast, several abnormalities were encountered during reconstitution. The process resulted in visible deformities, including clammy skin, and an irregular facial structure with one eye being noticeably larger than the other. These features clearly mark him as a vat-grown clone, though no functional impairments have been reported.

# Side-Effects:

**Physical Abnormalities**: Ironshell’s facial deformities, notably the asymmetry of his eyes and clammy skin, are a direct result of the cloning process.

**Psychological Impact**: No major cognitive impairments were detected, but Pilot Hetzenauer has expressed discomfort with his altered appearance. As a result, he now chooses to wear a helmet at all times during both combat and off-duty hours.

# Psychological Report:
Post-reconstitution psychological evaluations indicate that Pilot Hetzenauer remains mentally sound and fully mission-capable. There are no signs of trauma or psychological fragmentation from the reconstitution process itself. However, his self-image issues may have long-term psychological effects, which will be closely monitored.

**Medical Officer in Charge**: Dr. Elias Grant

**Approval Status**: Cleared for Active Duty

# This report is to be maintained in Pilot Matthäus Hetzenauer’s personnel file for future reference concerning his reconstitution history and potential medical follow-ups.
