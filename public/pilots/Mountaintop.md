Josh Batrich was once a security officer for ISP-N's anti piracy patrols, he took the job thinking he'd be mostly relaxing through core world space with the occasional rag tag group of pirates to scare off. What actually happened was on his first assignment out of training the trade convoy he was a part of was attacked and boarded by a group of pirates just hiding behind a local asteroid field. Josh panicked at the sight of pirates using lancers to board his shipâ€™s hangar bay and hid in the engineering ducts. When the smoke cleared and security managed to retake the ship and repel the pirates, Josh was found, reprimanded and dismissed from ISP-N with little else but the clothes on his back. Josh still wanted to explore the galaxy and the images of those lancers diving from exploding ships through vacuum and into the hangar bay couldnt leave his mind. The very next day Josh applied for a Lancer licence at his local GMS frame printer and made there was as much gun and armour between him and the enemy as possible.
