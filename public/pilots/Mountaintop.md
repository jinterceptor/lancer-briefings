# Known Background
Josh Batrich’s career began with what he believed would be a relatively easy position in ISP-N’s anti-piracy patrols, expecting to spend most of his time in core space, away from real danger. However, during his first assignment, his convoy was ambushed by pirates. The sight of Lancers boarding the ship sent him into a panic, and he hid during the attack. Though the ship was eventually secured, Josh’s failure to act led to his dismissal. Determined to redeem himself, he pursued a career as a Lancer, inspired by the same combat machines that had once terrified him. Now, he operates with a focus on defense, ensuring that he is never caught unprepared again.

# Psychological Profile
Mountaintop exhibits a deep-seated need for security and control, traits that likely stem from his traumatic early experiences with piracy.

Despite his rough start, Mountaintop has grown into a reliable and steady pilot, capable of holding the line under immense pressure. He is known for his calm, measured responses in combat, often acting as the foundation around which his team operates. While he still occasionally struggles with anxiety in high-stress situations, his commitment to improving and his desire to protect others drive him to push through these challenges.

# Evaluation
Mountaintop is a solid, dependable pilot who excels in defensive and support roles. His experience with ISP-N and his personal growth since his dismissal have made him a resilient and determined operator. While he lacks the aggressive tendencies of some of his peers, his defensive tactics provide a necessary balance to Scythe Company’s more offensive-minded members. Mountaintop’s ability to absorb damage and maintain battlefield presence makes him an indispensable part of the team.

# Recommendation
Mountaintop should continue to be assigned to missions where a strong defensive presence is required. His ability to withstand pressure and his steady, composed nature make him a valuable asset in protracted engagements. Encouragement and opportunities to develop his leadership potential should be considered, as his calm demeanor could serve him well in command roles.
