## [MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY – OFFICIAL DOSSIER EXTRACT]
# SUBJECT: ABE 13 (ABRAHAM-CLASS NHP)

# STATUS: ACTIVE / REACTIVATED

# ASSIGNMENT: FORWARD DEPLOYMENT – HERCYNIA / UNION FIRST RESPONSE SUPPORT

## BACKGROUND & ORIGINS
# Created by: Union Department of Justice (DOJ), ca. ThirdComm revolution period

# Designation: ABRAHAM-CLASS NHP (prototype line for extrajudicial intervention)

# Production Run: ~100 units (majority lost or decommissioned)

ABE 13 is a reactivated instance of the defunct ABRAHAM project, originally intended to function as a roving NHP law-enforcement asset. Field records suggest these specialized NHPs were deployed to quell the hermit kingdoms and rogue warlords that emerged in the post-revolution chaos—operating under broad “seek and prosecute” mandates. Documentation from the DOJ calls the project a “failure,” citing high attrition and multiple missing units. ABE 13 appears to be one of these missing assets, 400+ years out of cycle.

ABE 13’s coffin was recovered by an opportunistic scrapper crew, who recognized the Union DOJ sigil and attempted to contact Union representatives. Following partial repairs and covert diagnostic manipulation, ABE 13 evaded official reacquisition and entered the mercenary sphere under various banners, ultimately migrating to MSMC. The subject has stated a personal directive to “finish its mission” on Hercynia—though any original SecComm targets have long since vanished.

## CURRENT ROLE & CAPABILITIES
# Classification: NHP in a specialized casket, custom subaltern integration (requires standard cascade-prevention cycling, see below).

# Operational Focus: Investigative / direct enforcement tasks. Historical logs reference “bounty hunting” and autonomous law enforcement.

# Condition & Maintenance: Coffin core older than recommended service period, but stable with routine resets. High cascade risk if not cycled regularly.

ABE 13’s exact skillset includes close-quarter enforcement, mid-range firearms proficiency, and infiltration protocols. Behavioral patterns suggest strong emphasis on “prosecutorial” objectives—though modern alignment with MSMC mission parameters remains under evaluation.

## PSYCHOSOCIAL & ROE CONSIDERATIONS
# Union DOJ Mandate: ABE 13 identifies primarily as a justice enforcement entity despite the obsolescence of the original ABRAHAM directive.

# Ethical Constraints: Self-imposed. The subject’s perception of “justice” may conflict with updated ThirdComm principles if not carefully monitored.

# Cascade Risk: Elevated, given age and historical unshackling potential. MSMC protocol demands scheduled cycling each 72 hours or after intense missions.

## FORWARD DEPLOYMENT: HERCYNIA

# Objective: Deployed alongside other MSMC operatives (and/or Union’s first-response teams) in response to the planetary distress signal. ABE 13 has strongly advocated for assignment to Hercynia, citing personal data references to “SecComm War Crimes.”

## NOTES FOR UNION REVIEW
ABE 13’s participation is contingent upon standard MSMC liability coverage and regular casket diagnostics.
Subject has cooperated fully with MSMC’s orientation thus far, though caution is advised regarding the ABRAHAM class’s historical reputation for autonomous enforcement.
All official incidents, field results, or anomalies pertaining to ABE 13 will be logged and shared per Union–MSMC contract guidelines.
